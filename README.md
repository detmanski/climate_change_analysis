# climate_change_analysis

Summary:
  - Using machine learning to predict global warming impacts based on data over the last 60 years.
  - Target y values indicates the temperature prediction in next 40 years

Areas of research:
  - deforestation/forest fires
  - Global temperature change
  - CO2 gas levels
  - Rising Sea Levels
  - Ocean Warming
 
This inforvation can be adventageous in numerous ways:
  - Emergency preparedness
  - Encourage governments and industry leaders to implement more sustainable practices
  - Encourage consumers to make more sustainable choices in their daily lives
